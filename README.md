# Doubly-Linked-List
Doubly linked list with head and tail pointers.

The following operations are supported:

  DoublyLinkedList(): Default constructor.

  void reverse(): reverses the nodes of the linked list.

  DoublyLinkedList(DoublyLinkedList<T>  const & list): Copy constructor  that does deep copy.


  void deleteAtTail(): deletes the last node of the linked list.
  
  void deleteAtStart(): deletes the first node of the linked list.
  
  void insertAtTail(T const data): inserts a new node at the end of the linked list.
  
  void insertAtHead(T const data): inserts a new node at the start of the linked list.
  
  void print(): prints the data present in each node.
  
  void removeDuplicates(): removes nodes with duplicate values.
  
  void deleteAll(): deletes all nodes of the linked list.
  
  ~DoublyLinkedList(): destructor.
